# WorkEase — Agentic Unified Intelligent Multi-Platform Communication System

**WorkEase** is an AI-powered desktop automation system designed to unify multiple communication and productivity tools — such as Gmail, Slack, and local Linux utilities — into a single intelligent workspace.  
It operates through a **multi-agent architecture**, where independent agents handle communication, task automation, and file management, all coordinated by a central supervisor agent.  

The goal of WorkEase is to reduce context-switching and improve productivity by enabling users to control their digital workspace through **natural voice commands** and **context-aware automation**.
