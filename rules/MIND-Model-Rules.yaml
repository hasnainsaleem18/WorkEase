# MIND-Model Rules File

# Overview
# The MIND-Model (Mesh Integration Networked Development Model) is a non-linear, interconnected SDLC framework for AI-driven software engineering. This rules file defines nodes, connections, governance, and AI integration for IDEs and workflows.

# Core Rules
model:
  name: MIND-Model
  description: Mesh Integration Networked Development Model - A non-linear, interconnected SDLC framework.
  principles:
    - Interconnection: Every stage influences others.
    - Parallelism: Multiple processes run simultaneously.
    - Feedback Fluidity: Free flow of information for error correction.
    - Resilience: Alternate pathways for stability.
